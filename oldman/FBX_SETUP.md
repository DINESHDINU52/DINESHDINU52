# FBX 3D Model Setup Guide

This project now supports loading and displaying FBX 3D models using Three.js and FBXLoader.

## 🎯 What's Been Done

1. **Modified `index.html`**: 
   - Added Three.js and FBXLoader libraries
   - Replaced the iframe container with a div that will hold the Three.js canvas
   - Added the FBX loader script

2. **Created `fbx-loader.js`**:
   - Loads and displays FBX models
   - Includes magical particle effects
   - Supports animated FBX models
   - Auto-rotates the model for a magical effect
   - Falls back to the original iframe if FBX loading fails

## 📝 How to Use

### Step 1: Add Your FBX File

Place your FBX file in the appropriate location:
```
assets/models/your-file.fbx
```

### Step 2: Update the Path

Edit `fbx-loader.js` and change the `fbxPath` in the config:

```javascript
const config = {
    fbxPath: 'assets/models/your-file.fbx',
    fallbackUrl: 'https://dineshdinu52.github.io/DINESHDINU52/3dmodel/index.html'
};
```

### Step 3: Test

Open your browser and check the console for any errors. The model should load automatically.

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Model Scale
In `fbx-loader.js`, find the line:
```javascript
model.scale.set(0.1, 0.1, 0.1);
```
Adjust the values to scale your model up or down.

### Adjust Camera Position
```javascript
camera.position.set(0, 5, 15);
```
Change these values to position the camera differently:
- First value: X position
- Second value: Y position  
- Third value: Z position (distance from model)

### Modify Lighting
The scene includes three lights:
- **Ambient Light**: General lighting
- **Directional Light**: Main light source
- **Point Light**: Accent lighting

Adjust colors and intensity in the `initFBXLoader()` function.

### Disable Auto-Rotation
In the `initFBXLoader()` function, remove or comment out:
```javascript
controls.autoRotate = true;
```

### Change Particle Count
```javascript
const particleCount = 100;
```
Increase or decrease this number for more/fewer magical particles.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading?
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the FBX file path is correct
3. Ensure the FBX file is accessible
4. Check that the file is a valid FBX format

### Three.js Not Working?
- The script automatically falls back to the iframe if Three.js fails
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection to load the CDN resources

### Performance Issues?
- Reduce the particle count
- Simplify your FBX model
- Disable auto-rotation
